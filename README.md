# react-nyt
  I created a new React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. This app will work with helper/util functions, and utilize the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later.
# How to use it.
First the user wil have to type the name of the article in the input field Article Name, and the dates of interest. Once the user clicks on the submit search button all the articles available for that time frame will appear in the results section and each article will have a direct link to the article and the option to save it for later. In addition, users will have the option to delete articles the no longer want.
# Technologies:
Node js.
React.
MongoDB.
